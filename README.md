# MedicoRescue
Abstract— A total of 4.3 lakh road accidents were recorded across India in 2019, resulting in the death of nearly 1.5 lakh people and also left many injured according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. The number of road accidents are increasing day by day. Most of the casualties are caused because of delay in proper services to take the injured to the hospital. We all have part to play in reducing the unfortunate accidents and saving lives of people. Hence our aim is to create a platform that can help the victims of any road accident by helping the witnesses of the accident to connect to nearest public vehicle like auto rickshaw that can take the injured to the hospital. With the help of this system a notification will be sent to the hospital as well so that it will be aware about a patient coming in and can keep the required arrangements ready before hand.

Along with the mobile application we are also planning to make a web application for hospital which will be connected to the mobile app. When the driver chooses the closest hospital, a notification will be sent to the hospital to inform them that a road accident victim is about to arrive. This will save the time spent in the hospital for the admission formalities and even the hospital can be ready with the necessary arrangements. In this way we are planning to make a one click service that can give almost immediate help to the injured and victims of road accidents.
